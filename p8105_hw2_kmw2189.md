# Problem 1

## Importing and cleaning Mr. Trash Wheel Data

``` r
library(readxl)
trash_wheel = read_excel(path = "./data/mr_trash_wheel_data.xlsx", 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(vol_y3 = volume_cubic_yards, cigs = cigarette_butts) %>% 
  select(-x15) %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster:date) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))
```

    ## New names:
    ## * `` -> ...15

## Importing and cleaning 2017 precipitation data

``` r
precip_2017 = read_excel(path = "./data/mr_trash_wheel_data.xlsx", 4, skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(total_in = total) %>% 
    mutate(
    total_in = na_if(total_in, 0),
    year = "2017") %>% 
  drop_na(total_in, month) %>% 
  select(year, month, total_in)
```

## Importing and cleaning 2018 precipitation data

``` r
precip_2018 = read_excel(path = "./data/mr_trash_wheel_data.xlsx", 3, skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(total_in = total) %>% 
  mutate(
    total_in = na_if(total_in, 0),
    year = "2018") %>% 
   drop_na(total_in, month) %>% 
  select(year, month, total_in)
```

convert month to a character variable (the variable month.name is built
into R and should be useful).

## Joining 2017 and 2018 precipitation data

``` r
precip_bind = bind_rows(precip_2017, precip_2018) 
  ##mutate(
    ##month = month.name,
    ##as.character(month))
##error message: Error: Column `month` must be length 18 (the number of rows) or one, not 12
```

Mr. Trash Wheel is a trash interceptor that removes trash as it enters
Baltimore’s Inner Harbor. Between May 2014 and July 2018 Mr.Trash Wheel
brought in a total of 285 dumpsters full of trash. The average dumpster
weighed 3.28 tons with a volume of 15.58 cubic yards. Trash collected in
the dumpsters included cigarette butts, plastic bottles, sports balls,
and grocery bags, among others. Mr. Trash Wheel is most active just
after a precipitation event. Between 2017 and 2018 there was a total of
18 months with precipitation. 2017 had higher total precipitation with
32.93 inches and 2018 had a total of 23.5 inches. The median number of
sports balls collected per dumpster in 2017 was 8 and the 2018 median
was also 8.

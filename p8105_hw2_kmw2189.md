# Problem 1

## Importing and tidying Mr. Trash Wheel data

``` r
library(readxl)
trash_wheel = read_excel(path = "./data/mr_trash_wheel_data_aug19.xlsx", 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  ## creating reasonable variable names
  rename(vol_y3 = volume_cubic_yards, cigs = cigarette_butts) %>% 
  ## omit non-data entries
  select(-x15, -x16, -x17) %>% 
  ## omit rows that do not include dumpster-sepcific data
  drop_na(dumpster:date) %>%
  ## round number of sports balls to the closest integer and convert to integer
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))
```

## Importing and tidying 2017 precipitation data

``` r
precip_2017 = read_excel(path = "./data/mr_trash_wheel_data_aug19.xlsx", 6, skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(total_in = total) %>% 
  mutate(
    total_in = na_if(total_in, 0),
    year = "2017"
    ) %>% 
  drop_na(total_in, month) %>% 
  select(year, month, total_in)
```

## Importing and tidying 2018 precipitation data

``` r
precip_2018 = read_excel(path = "./data/mr_trash_wheel_data_aug19.xlsx", 5, skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(total_in = total) %>% 
  mutate(
    total_in = na_if(total_in, 0),
    year = "2018"
    ) %>% 
  drop_na(total_in, month) %>% 
  select(year, month, total_in)
```

## Joining 2017 and 2018 precipitation data

``` r
precip_bind = bind_rows(precip_2017, precip_2018) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

Mr. Trash Wheel is a trash interceptor that removes trash as it enters
Baltimore’s Inner Harbor. Between May 2014 and June 2019 Mr.Trash Wheel
brought in a total of 344 dumpsters full of trash. The average dumpster
weighed 3.26 tons with a volume of 15.54 cubic yards. Trash collected in
the dumpsters included cigarette butts, plastic bottles, sports balls,
and grocery bags, among others. Mr. Trash Wheel is most active just
after a precipitation event. Between 2017 and 2018 there was a total of
23 months with precipitation. 2017 had lower total precipitation with
32.93 inches compared to a total of 70.33 inches in 2018. The median
number of sports balls collected per dumpster in 2017 was 8 and the 2018
median was also 8.

# Problem 2

## Importing and tidying the monthly poll data

``` r
## Importing dataset
pols_month = read_csv(file = "./data/pols_month.csv") %>% 
  ## separating month from 1 column into 3
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>% 
   mutate(
    ## mutate month into numeric in order to use the month.name var
    month = as.numeric(month),
    month = month.name[month],
    ## converting year to integer to keep consistent in merge
    year = as.integer(year),
    ##create president variable
    president = ifelse(prez_gop > 0, "gop", "dem")
    ) %>%
  select(-prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day) %>% 
  arrange(year, month, desc(year))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

## Importing and tidying the S\&P data

``` r
snp_data = read_csv(file = "./data/snp.csv") %>% 
  mutate( 
    date = lubridate::mdy(date)
    ) %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>% 
  mutate(
    month = as.numeric(month),
    month = month.name[month], 
    year = as.integer(year),
  ) %>% 
  select(-day) %>% 
  arrange(year, month, desc(year))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

## Importing and tidying unemployment dataset

``` r
unemploy_data = read_csv(file = "./data/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    jan:dec,
    names_to = "month", 
    values_to = "unemploy_pct"
    ) %>%
  mutate(
    year = as.integer(year),
    month = recode(month, "jan" = "January", "feb" = "February", "mar" = "March", "apr" = "April", "may" = "May", "jun" = "June", "jul" = "July", "aug" = "August", "sep" = "September", "oct" = "October", "nov" = "November", "dec" = "December")
  ) %>% 
  arrange(year, month, desc(year))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Jan = col_double(),
    ##   Feb = col_double(),
    ##   Mar = col_double(),
    ##   Apr = col_double(),
    ##   May = col_double(),
    ##   Jun = col_double(),
    ##   Jul = col_double(),
    ##   Aug = col_double(),
    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

## Merging

``` r
## snp_data into pols_month data 
pols_month_snp_data = 
  left_join(pols_month, snp_data, by = c("year", "month"))

## unemploy_data into pols_month and snp combined
pols_snp_unemploy_data =
  left_join(pols_month_snp_data, unemploy_data, by = c("year", "month"))
```

The data contained in Problem 2 summarizes the seats held by each U.S
political party, the S\&P stock growth, and the U.S. unemployment rate
over time. The monthly poll data contains the politicial parties of the
house, senate, and president for each month from 1947 to 2015 for a
total of 822 months of data. The S\&P stock dataset shows that the
average close was 474.89 points with a high of 2107.39 and a low of
17.05. The unemployment dataset shows the unemployment rate of the U.S
per month. The maximum unemployment rate was NA

# Problem 3

## Importing and tidying baby names data

``` r
baby_names = read_csv(file = "./data/popular_baby_names.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  rename(year = year_of_birth , name = childs_first_name) %>% 
  mutate(
    year = as.factor(year),
    rank = as.numeric(rank),
    ethnicity = recode(ethnicity,"ASIAN AND PACI" = "ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER", "BLACK NON HISP" = "BLACK NON HISPANIC", "WHITE NON HISP" = "WHITE NON HISPANIC"),
    name = as.factor(toupper(name))
    ) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  select(year, gender, ethnicity, name, rank, count)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   `Year of Birth` = col_double(),
    ##   Gender = col_character(),
    ##   Ethnicity = col_character(),
    ##   `Child's First Name` = col_character(),
    ##   Count = col_double(),
    ##   Rank = col_double()
    ## )
